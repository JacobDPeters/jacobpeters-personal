                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>At the start of each school year or semester, teachers are often faced with the challenge of identifying and remembering hundreds of new student names and faces.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Product Solution</h2>
                    <p>By using spaced repetition and a Leitner system common in language learning, teachers are able to learn student names and faces in the least amount of time. Having a scheduled review session before classes helps teachers brush up on the specific students they are having trouble remembering. </p>

                    <h2>Users & Audience</h2>
                    <p>The target users of Student Faces are teachers, primarily those teaching middle school through university, as those are typically the teachers with more than a single class worth of student names to remember.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>Their goal is to be able to cut down on the time it takes them to remember all their new students each semester/year. They are often busy, so being able to learn in small gaps of free time (between class periods for example) is important to them.</p>

                    <p>Variation on a three box Leitner system (an implementation of spaced repetition) to determine which students are shown to teachers. Students are sorted into ‘difficult’ or ‘learning’ depending on whether the teacher remembered them correctly during the initial review. Students are moved up a category when correct and down when incorrect. This allows teachers to focus on learning the student names they have difficulty with, rather than just mass reviewing an entire class at once, leading to less time spent to achieve the end result of knowing all student names.</p>
